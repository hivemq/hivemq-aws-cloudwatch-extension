= HiveMQ AWS Cloudwatch Extension


== Purpose

This Extension allows to report HiveMQ metrics to AWS Cloudwatch.

It is possible to send every HiveMQ metric to Cloudwatch. Every metric which should be reported
must be configured explicitly to reduce the costs, since Cloudwatch can be expensive if you
publish too much (unnecessary) data.


[CAUTION]
.AWS Cloudwatch costs
====
AWS Cloudwatch metrics can be *very* expensive. So please make sure you really want to report the specified metrics.
You can find the full AWS pricing https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/[here].

At the time of writing the AWS prices are the following:

* `$0.50` per custom metric
* `$0.01` per 1000 _GetMetricStatistics_, _ListMetrics_, or _PutMetricData_ requests

====

Unzip the file: `hivemq-cloudwatch-extension-<version>-distribution.zip` to the directory: `<HIVEMQ_HOME>/extensions`
